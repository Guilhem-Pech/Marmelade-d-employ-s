#The last pot

The game :

The last pot is a 2D pixelart narrative game. You play as Alyssia, the dreamed employee on her last day of duty in a company where she worked all her life. But beware of the calm water... 
This short game was made during the ENJAM, from CNAM-ENJMIN (France, Angoulême) within 48 hours. The subject was "Party like there's no tomorrow".
Trigger warning : violence, gore.
